<p><em>Edited Scout7 Player Profile with Jamie Benson‚Äôs additions and annotation</em></p>

<p>Watford requests:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúWithin the platform there will be a database of players from around the world which when Searched or clicked on, will link to an individual page.</p>

  <p>The player profile will have key background information clearly displayed, as well as an audit of activity based on any reports, notes or information scouts have added to his profile.</p>

  <p>Additionally, he will have statistical information based on clearly defined KPI‚Äôs and a table/chart highlighting his scores given (if he has been reported on).</p>

  <p>User-configurable widgets/views to show useful information</p>

  <p>Polygon (top right) to show both FM data and/or metrics</p>

  <p>Graph/Table (bottom left) to be user configurable/change axes based on user reports‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Player profiles will be similar to those found in FM, but altered to provide relevant information.</p>
