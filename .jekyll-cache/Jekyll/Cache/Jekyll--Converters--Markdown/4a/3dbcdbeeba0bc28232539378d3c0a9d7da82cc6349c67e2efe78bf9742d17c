<p>Watford Audit Tool Requests:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúAn Audit Tool will be essential to keep track of, and log platform activity for historical reference and review.</p>

  <p>By storing historical user activity the department can refer back to any changes that have been made such as:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>players being deleted from shortlists</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>players added to shortlists</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>notes added</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>teams/players watched/reported</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>reports uploaded etc</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Furthermore the Audit Tool can be used in a review process to critically review the recruitment processes over a season or specific transfer window (e.g. reviewing a summer transfer window as to players watched/ discarded, players highlighted, signed and actions that have been taken).</p>

  <p>By having a critical review, the department can highlight any specific needs or areas for improvement going forward (i.e. positional biases) and providing context to why certain players were targeted or not.‚Äù</p>
