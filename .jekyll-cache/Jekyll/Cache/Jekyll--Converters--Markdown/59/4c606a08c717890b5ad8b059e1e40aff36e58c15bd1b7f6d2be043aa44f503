<p>Watford want to keep the same report format that they currently use with Scout7, so we will try to replicate it as closely as possible.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Watford player report requests:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Individual reports will have the basic match information as seen above in the Match Report, including the starting line ups diagram.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Each report will be broken down into four primary areas:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Physical</li>
          <li>With The Ball</li>
          <li>Without The Ball</li>
          <li>Personality</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Each has specific characteristics within those categories to be scored and commented on, along with a final “Gut Instinct” score.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As mentioned, each report will have a total of 12 categories to score, with each attribute being scored out of four:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 = poor</li>
          <li>2 = didn’t show enough quality to fit our profile</li>
          <li>3 = shows potential to fit the profile</li>
          <li>4 = fits the profile.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
