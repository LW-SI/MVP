<h1 id="shortlists">Shortlists</h1>

<p><img src="/img/scout7shortlist.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Below was requested from Watford for this feature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“From the dashboard homepage, another key widget needed is the ability to display, edit and present relevant shortlists which can easily be added to with historical recording of players being taken off (audit tool).</p>

  <p>These shortlists can be created, shared and viewed by all, with specific restrictions in place as required.</p>

  <p>Separately, scouts can create their own shortlists and ‘lock’ it so only they can view it.</p>

  <p>The way in which these are displayed are decided by the user with the flexibility to display in list format as well as pitch view.”</p>
