I"<p>What is it?
An online platform (with offline capabilities) using an customizable interface made from interchangeable pre-built modules to suit the recruitment and research needs of an individual scouting department, where collected data is owned by the club.</p>

<p>What is it not?</p>

<p>A generic scout report tool used by many different clubs where data is owned by the service provider.</p>

<p>Who Is it for?
Clubs that require any or all of the following:</p>

<p>sophisticated and bespoke organisation of their recruitment operations
collection of their scouting reports into a searchable database
reliable information on their existing targets
assistance in the identification of new targets
The multitude of functions would also make the software useful for football professionals outside of clubs such as:</p>

<p>media
journalists
agents
oddsmakers</p>

<p>What are the Pillars of the product?</p>

<p>For the product to be worthwhile and competitive in the market, there are six core Pillars that must be achieved:</p>

<p>Ease of use
Speed
Offline functionality
Mobile functionality
Translation support
Data owned by user, not provider</p>

<p>Ease of Use</p>

<p>The user base will include a wide range of users with variying levels of computer literacy
The product must be useable by both the data analyst and the old school scout or club owner
It should be quick to learn to minimize barriers to entry for use</p>

<p>Speed</p>

<p>As the product will be used out in a live environment where data will need be recorded quickly, speed is essential
The database also needs to be queried and extracted quickly to prevent frustration</p>

<p>Offline Functionality</p>

<p>The product will need to be used in environments with limited on no internet connectivity (football stadiums, cars, trains, planes etc)</p>

<p>Mobile Functionality</p>

<p>Product will need to be used in environments where the user is unable to use desktops/laptops (football stadiums, cars, trains, planes etc)</p>

<p>Translation Support</p>

<p>Product will need to be accessible to an international audience to reflect the global nature of modern football
Particularly useful for organisations such as Watford/Udinese with an international team</p>

<p>Data owned by user, not provider</p>

<p>Most equivalent products retain ownership of data that is generated and collected
This product will guarantee users ownership and manipulation of their own data</p>

<p>What is the minimum viable product? (for initial launch with Watford FC)
A searchable repository for a club’s scout reports
A way to organise scouting assignments

<p>What are the stretch goals? (for initial launch with Watford FC)</p>

<p>Mobile/tablet/offline functionality
This is a product Pillar and something that will be at the core of the application long-term
However in the short-term Watford are comfortable with this being a stretch goal rather than part of the minimum viable product
User Audit Tool to analyse user’s contributions (what’s been going on in the system)
Depth Charts
Current Season Depth Chart</p>

<p>Future Depth Chart</p>

<p>Conceptual Depth Chart
Comparison
Watford to confirm final list of stretch goals
What features would the ideal product include?
Improved assessment tools</p>

<p>Should be an option to either use the package provided by SI or integrate the user’s existing video software package subscription (Wyscout, Instat etc)
Playing style insights</p>

<p>Improved identification tools
Points-Based Performance Analysis tool
Watford have a version of this based around what they call ‘Snapshots’
Quick Search
Quick Search dropdown in title with ability to apply filters
Display recent searches
Favourites/Save Searches
Use of FM Researchers as scouts
In-app functionality would be fairly easy to implement
Would however require lengthy process recruitment and training of researchers (after establishing training regime)
Improved Dashboard
Personal Diary widget
League Tables widget<br />
Statistical Insights widget
Improved Reports
Position-Based Reports
Watford don’t want this
Speech-To-Text for dictated scout reports

Watford want to use the platform for the January 2021 transfer window
