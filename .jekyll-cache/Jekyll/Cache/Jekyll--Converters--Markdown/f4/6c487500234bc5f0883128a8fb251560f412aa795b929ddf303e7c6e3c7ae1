<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p>An online platform (with offline capabilities) using an customizable interface made from interchangeable pre-built modules to suit the recruitment and research needs of an individual scouting department, where collected data is owned by the club.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-it-not">What is it not?</h2>

<p>A generic scout report tool used by many different clubs where data is owned by the service provider.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h2>
<p>Clubs that require any or all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sophisticated and bespoke organisation of their recruitment operations</li>
  <li>collection of their scouting reports into a searchable database</li>
  <li>reliable information on their existing targets</li>
  <li>assistance in the identification of new targets</li>
</ul>

<p>The multitude of functions would also make the software useful for football professionals outside of clubs such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>media</li>
  <li>journalists</li>
  <li>agents</li>
  <li>oddsmakers</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-the-pillars-of-the-product">What are the Pillars of the product?</h2>

<p>For the product to be worthwhile and competitive in the market, there are six core Pillars that must be achieved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ease of use</li>
  <li>Speed</li>
  <li>Offline functionality</li>
  <li>Mobile functionality</li>
  <li>Translation support</li>
  <li>Data owned by user, not provider</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ease-of-use">Ease of Use</h4>

<p>The user base will include a wide range of users with variying levels of computer literacy
The product must be useable by both the data analyst and the old school scout or club owner
It should be quick to learn to minimize barriers to entry for use</p>

<h4 id="speed">Speed</h4>

<p>As the product will be used out in a live environment where data will need be recorded quickly, speed is essential
The database also needs to be queried and extracted quickly to prevent frustration</p>

<h4 id="offline-functionality">Offline Functionality</h4>

<p>The product will need to be used in environments with limited on no internet connectivity (football stadiums, cars, trains, planes etc)</p>

<h4 id="mobile-functionality">Mobile Functionality</h4>

<p>Product will need to be used in environments where the user is unable to use desktops/laptops (football stadiums, cars, trains, planes etc)</p>

<h4 id="translation-support">Translation Support</h4>

Particularly useful for organisations such as Watford/Udinese with an international team</p>

<h4 id="data-owned-by-user-not-provider">Data owned by user, not provider</h4>
