<p>Watford Snapshot Request:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As part of the recruitment strategy a numeric grading system has been created (see below) to highlight and shortlist players based upon a set criteria. 
Primarily used to highlight up-and-coming/young prospects, this tool is used to provide weekly insights to UK based players playing in the Premier League, Championship, League 1 and league 2. 
Furthermore, as seen below, the players are recorded weekly with trend data compiled to provide weekly, monthly and seasonal averages which highlight key performing players to then view live. 
Additionally it is used to support our current live scouting structure. 
If this system can be also built into the platform it will be invaluable in not only providing relevant insights but to also save time and resources elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, this will be a fully customisable and automated trend data and snapshot section where each week the selected leagues get published for viewing.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Additionally, a list of every player at 18 or below involved in match day squads for selected leagues are also highlighted to prompt scouting procedures for U23s/U18s.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All data tracked week to week is then stored in a table for future reference</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jamie Benson is working on a financial element to this to predict player values</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compliation of data is currently done by interns, but should be automated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Watfordâ€™s name for this is â€˜Snapshotâ€™, but will need to think of a different name for SI version, which will have improved functionality.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
