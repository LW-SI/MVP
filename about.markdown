# FMdB Pro Overview

## What is it?
An online platform (with offline capabilities) using an customizable interface made from interchangeable pre-built modules to suit the recruitment and research needs of an individual scouting department, where collected data is owned by the club. 


## What is it not?

A generic scout report tool used by many different clubs where data is owned by the service provider. 


## Who is it for?
Clubs that require any or all of the following:

- sophisticated and bespoke organisation of their recruitment operations
- collection of their scouting reports into a searchable database
- reliable information on their existing targets
- assistance in the identification of new targets

The multitude of functions would also make the software useful for football professionals outside of clubs such as: 

- media
- journalists
- agents
- oddsmakers 


## What are the Pillars of the product?

For the product to be worthwhile and competitive in the market, there are six core Pillars that must be achieved:

- Ease of use
- Speed
- Offline functionality
- Mobile functionality
- Translation support
- Data owned by user, not provider


#### Ease of Use

The user base will include a wide range of users with variying levels of computer literacy
The product must be useable by both the data analyst and the old school scout or club owner
It should be quick to learn to minimize barriers to entry for use


#### Speed

As the product will be used out in a live environment where data will need be recorded quickly, speed is essential
The database also needs to be queried and extracted quickly to prevent frustration


#### Offline Functionality

The product will need to be used in environments with limited on no internet connectivity (football stadiums, cars, trains, planes etc)


#### Mobile Functionality

Product will need to be used in environments where the user is unable to use desktops/laptops (football stadiums, cars, trains, planes etc)


#### Translation Support

Product will need to be accessible to an international audience to reflect the global nature of modern football
Particularly useful for organisations such as Watford/Udinese with an international team


#### Data owned by user, not provider

Most equivalent products retain ownership of data that is generated and collected
This product will guarantee users ownership and manipulation of their own data


## What is the minimum viable product? (for initial launch with Watford FC)
- A searchable repository for a club's scout reports
- A way to organise scouting assignments
- A recruitment planning board where shortlists can be created
- An interface to search the FM database for players/other FM data
- A dashboard from which to access the other features and view key information at a glance

#### Scout Reports

- Player Reports
- Sortable, filterable search interface


#### Scouting Assignment Organisation

	- Comparison
	- Media

	- History


#### Dashboard

## What are the stretch goals? (for initial launch with Watford FC)

- Mobile/tablet/offline functionality
	- This is a product pillar and something that will be at the core of the application long-term
	- However in the short-term Watford are comfortable with this being a stretch goal rather than part of the minimum viable product
- User Audit Tool to analyse user's contributions (what's been going on in the system)
- Depth Charts
	- Current Season Depth Chart
	- Future Depth Chart
	- Conceptual Depth Chart
- Comparison
- Watford to confirm final list of stretch goals

## What features would the ideal product include?
- Improved assessment tools
- Integrated video player
	- Should be an option to either use the package provided by SI or integrate the user's existing video software package subscription (Wyscout, Instat etc)
- Playing style insights
- Improved identification tools
- Points-Based Performance Analysis tool
	- Watford have a version of this based around what they call 'Snapshots'
- Quick Search
	- Quick Search dropdown in title with ability to apply filters
	- Display recent searches
	- Favourites/Save Searches
- Use of FM Researchers as scouts
	- In-app functionality would be fairly easy to implement
	- Would however require lengthy process recruitment and training of researchers (after establishing training regime)
- Improved Dashboard
	- Personal Diary widget
	- League Tables widget  
	- Statistical Insights widget
	- Improved Reports
	- Position-Based Reports
	- Watford don't want this
- Speech-To-Text for dictated scout reports
- Presentation Editor


## When does the project need to be completed? 
- Watford want to use the platform for the January 2021 transfer window
- Probably need to revisit this given scope and time remaining
