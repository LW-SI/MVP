# History/Audit Tool

Watford Audit Tool Requests:
> "An Audit Tool will be essential to keep track of, and log platform activity for historical reference and review. 
>
> By storing historical user activity the department can refer back to any changes that have been made such as:

> - players being deleted from shortlists

> - players added to shortlists

> - notes added

> - teams/players watched/reported

> - reports uploaded etc
> 
> Furthermore the Audit Tool can be used in a review process to critically review the recruitment processes over a season or specific transfer window (e.g. reviewing a summer transfer window as to players watched/ discarded, players highlighted, signed and actions that have been taken). 
> 
> By having a critical review, the department can highlight any specific needs or areas for improvement going forward (i.e. positional biases) and providing context to why certain players were targeted or not."
