# Profiles

![](img/scout7playerprofileannotated.png)

*Edited Scout7 Player Profile with Jamie Benson's additions and annotation*

Watford requests:

> "Within the platform there will be a database of players from around the world which when Searched or clicked on, will link to an individual page.
>
> The player profile will have key background information clearly displayed, as well as an audit of activity based on any reports, notes or information scouts have added to his profile. 
>
> Additionally, he will have statistical information based on clearly defined KPI’s and a table/chart highlighting his scores given (if he has been reported on).
>
> User-configurable widgets/views to show useful information
>
> Polygon (top right) to show both FM data and/or metrics
>
> Graph/Table (bottom left) to be user configurable/change axes based on user reports"
