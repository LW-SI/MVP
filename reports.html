# Reports

More information about player profiles can be found here: [Player Profiles](/profile)

Watford want to keep the same report format that they currently use with Scout7, so we will try to replicate it as closely as possible.

### Reports Widget

This will be displayed on the dashboard. Clicking it will take the user to the Reports Overview.

### Reports Overview

Here the user can see all reports (listed chronologically descending by default but this will be editable).
From either this screen or the dashboard, a user can create a report. 

### Create Report
- User is given the option to create a report from either a Match or Player template
	- Position-specific reports will be possible in future but Watford do not want this functionality.

### Player Report

- As much information (height/weight etc) will be pre-filled as possible.

##### Recommendation options

- Watford player report requests:
	- Individual reports will have the basic match information as seen above in the Match Report, including the starting line ups diagram. 

	- Each report will be broken down into four primary areas:

		- Physical
		- With The Ball
		- Without The Ball
		- Personality

	- Each has specific characteristics within those categories to be scored and commented on, along with a final "Gut Instinct" score. 

	- As mentioned, each report will have a total of 12 categories to score, with each attribute being scored out of four:
		- 1 = poor
		- 2 = didnâ€™t show enough quality to fit our profile
		- 3 = shows potential to fit the profile
		- 4 = fits the profile.
