# Snapshot Tool (points-based performance analysis tool)

Watford Snapshot Request:
> As part of the recruitment strategy a numeric grading system has been created (see below) to highlight and shortlist players based upon a set criteria. 
> Primarily used to highlight up-and-coming/young prospects, this tool is used to provide weekly insights to UK based players playing in the Premier League, Championship, League 1 and league 2. 
> Furthermore, as seen below, the players are recorded weekly with trend data compiled to provide weekly, monthly and seasonal averages which highlight key performing players to then view live. 
> Additionally it is used to support our current live scouting structure. 
> If this system can be also built into the platform it will be invaluable in not only providing relevant insights but to also save time and resources elsewhere. 
> 
> Ultimately, this will be a fully customisable and automated trend data and snapshot section where each week the selected leagues get published for viewing. 

> Additionally, a list of every player at 18 or below involved in match day squads for selected leagues are also highlighted to prompt scouting procedures for U23s/U18s. 

- All data tracked week to week is then stored in a table for future reference

- Jamie Benson is working on a financial element to this to predict player values

- Compliation of data is currently done by interns, but should be automated. 

- Watford's name for this is 'Snapshot', but will need to think of a different name for SI version, which will have improved functionality.
